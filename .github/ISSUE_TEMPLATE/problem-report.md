# Description

_describe your problem including any hints to reproduce it:_

...

# Optional information

- device tree: _link_
- custom OS: _link to their manifest_

# Required(!) information

- Android version: `A9, A10, A11, ...`
- COMPLETE(!!!) output when executing: `vendor/extendrom/er.sh`

# Note

```
when sharing logs or longer texts it is recommended 
using a so-called "paste service". 

Here are some examples:

- https://gists.github.com (strongly recommended)

- https://hastebin.com
- https://controlc.com
- https://justpaste.me
- https://privatebin.net
- https://pastebin.com

Once you pasted your text in there you will get an URL
which you then can simply share.
```
